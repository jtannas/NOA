NOA: Nameless Organization App
---------------------------------------------------
When working as an engineer, my coworkers and I spent a huge portion of our time in meetings
    - sharing how much progress we've made
    - sharing what our priorities are
    - delegating tasks between people
    
Our managers were spending their time managing the day-to-day work instead of dealing with problems or planning for the future.
Borrowing inspiration from the IT department, I eventually set up a sort of ticket system in MS Access. Instead of everyone maintaining
a personal To-Do list, it became a shared To-Do list. Though it didn't actually accomplish any work by itself, it cut down on meetings 
and confusion and made the team more productive.

MS Access databases are not built for multiples users though. It's possible, but generally an unreliable pain in the a**.
My project will be to take that concept and then implement it in a web database.
